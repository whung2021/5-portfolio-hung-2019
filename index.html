People would have to play in front of the whole class so it would be embarassing if I didn't know how to play well. After I came to America, I joined band in 6th grade and Mr. Wright told me that the oboe has very similar fingering compared to the recorder. Therefore, I played the oboe for two years out of my three years in middle school.</p>

                                <p class="word" style="padding-top: 20px;">I switched to playing the saxophone in 9th grade since Ms. Hofius said that oboes cannot join marching band. Therefore, I bought my new saxophone when I was in Taiwan and I'm still playing it now. Compared to the oboe, saxophone does not need a delicate control of air, in fact, it needs lots of air to be blown through the horns. It is always nice to learn a new instrument and I look forward to continue playing saxophone next year.</p>

Civilization Revolution is one of the game I really enjoy playing because I enjoy empire building games in which you evaluate the resources you have and what you can afford to build or maintain for your empire not to collapse. It also develops strategies while also making it enjoyable throughout the game.</p>

                                <p class="word" style="padding-top: 20px;">Pokemon, though not using a ton of brain power when game playing, is my favorite game. First of all, though the game play itself does not require much thinking, competitive gaming in Pokemon actually requires a lot of thinking because it requires me to expect my opponent's move, calculate the damage of my Pokemon surviving, safely switch into a Pokemon that can tank a hit from my opponent, and taking risks and scout for my opponent's move some of the time (and of course, the unexpected RNG is always part of this). But overall, Pokemon does not provide me as much knowledge as Civilization does, but I enjoy anticipating and predicting my opponents' moves, outplaying them, and playing Pokemon with my friends.</p>

I enjoy watching both the MLB and NPB (Japanese Baseball) because of high caliber plays the players make. However, for me, coming from Taiwan, I also enjoy the CPBL. Baseball, being the "national sport" of Taiwan, is very important to me and a lot my classmates living there. Although we haven't won many notable players during international competitions recently, I'm sure they'll do well in the future if they continue to develop the younger players.</p>
